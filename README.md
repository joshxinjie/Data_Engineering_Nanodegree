# Data_Engineering_Nanodegree

## Projects
1. [Data Modeling with Postgres](1A_Data_Modeling_with_Postgres): Create a database and ETL pipeline in Postgres for a music streaming app. Apply the Star schema, define the Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into the tables.

2. [Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra](1B_Data_Modeling_with_Cassandra): Create a non-relational database and ETL pipeline with Apache Cassandra for a music streaming app.

3. [Data Warehouse with AWS Redshift](2_Data_Warehouse): Build an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms the data into a set of dimensional tables for analysis. Apply concepts from IaC to automate the creation of the Redshift cluster.

4. [Data Lake with AWS EMR and S3](3_Data_Lake): Build an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables.

5. Data Pipelines with Airflow

6. Capstone
